# cloud-hub

A multi-cloud design and operation site to understand AWS / Azure / Google Cloud / OCI not by service names, but by differences in **philosophy, resource boundaries, failure domains, and operator responsibilities**.

- Public site: https://hjosugi.github.io/cloud-hub/
- Latest Release: https://github.com/hjosugi/cloud-hub/releases/latest
- Repository: https://github.com/hjosugi/cloud-hub

## What can you understand

- What each cloud primarily isolates and controls
- How global/regional scope, IAM, high availability, and operational responsibilities differ even for equivalent services
- How to compare organization, network, identity, data, observability, disaster recovery, and costs
- How to find candidate clouds based on purpose and requirements without knowing service names
- How to compare published prices under the same capacity, uptime, and redundancy conditions
- What architecture, runbook, quota, and migration aspects are emphasized in official releases
- How to connect knowledge gained from certifications to real-world design decisions

## Design and operational guides

1. [Philosophies of the 4 clouds](docs/guides/cloud-philosophies.md)
2. [Multi-cloud design decision-making](docs/guides/multicloud-design.md)
3. [Operational model comparison](docs/guides/operations-comparison.md)
4. [How to read releases](docs/guides/release-intelligence.md)
5. [Purpose search and cost comparison](docs/guides/service-and-cost-comparison.md)

## Site information architecture

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Release Observation | Read official updates with design, operation, and cross-cloud perspectives |
| Cloud Philosophies | Compare boundary, control, and reliability philosophies of the 4 providers |
| Service Comparison | Map not only feature names but also purposes and responsibility scopes |
| Cost Comparison | Check published baseline prices and excluded items under the same input conditions |
| Network / IAM | Compare scopes, inheritance, and routing that are often confused |
| Operation Comparison | Standardize telemetry, audit, availability, and alerting language |
| Certifications & Learning | Supplement practical understanding with AIP-C01/PDE training materials |

## Release and intelligence

Official RSS/Atom feeds from the 4 clouds are fetched daily via GitHub Actions, and a lightweight Naive Bayes classifier with explicit rules assigns:

- Stage such as Preview / GA / Retirement / Security
- Impact on design
- Impact on operations
- Notes on areas covered by other clouds and points to watch during comparison
- Next steps for migration and verification

No always-on servers, databases, paid AI APIs, or public CORS proxies are used. For details, see [Feed intelligence architecture](docs/feed-intelligence.md).

## Certifications and learning as an auxiliary layer

- [AIP-C01 Domain Guide](docs/learning/aip-c01/domain-guide.md)
- [AIP-C01 Flashcards](docs/learning/aip-c01/flashcards.md)
- [AIP-C01 Scenario Exercises](docs/learning/aip-c01/scenario-drills.md)
- [GCP PDE Domain 1 condensed notes](docs/learning/gcp-pde/domain-1-notes.md)
- [Review only incorrect questions](docs/learning/README.md)

Don’t just stop at obtaining certifications—connect the judgment criteria of each question to the design and operations guides.
